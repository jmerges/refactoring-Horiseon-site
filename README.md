In this project, I was given a site template and asked to refactor it. I used GITHUB to clone the repository from UC Berkeley Bootcamp and to push my changes. I changed the div elements used on the page to semantic html elements for organization and search engine optimization purposes, and adjusted the corresponding css file accordingly.

## Tools and formats used:

html, css, GITHUB, GITLAB  
Site obtained from UC Berkeley Bootcamp:
